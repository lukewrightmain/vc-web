						<h1>Core Values</h1>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ms-container2">
						<p><strong>Love</strong> - God showed His unconditional love for us, and through our actions, we can demonstrate God's love to the children, families, co-workers, and everyone we meet. We know that while there are many aspects of our program that will support the growth of children, it is God's love that will last through their entire lifetime and into eternity. <em>1 John 4:11</em></p>
						<p><strong>Joy</strong> - Unconditional joy in all circumstances is found in eternal hope in Christ. The Lord has done great things for us and we are filled with joy. We will guide children with words and examples in finding joy in all things and being joyful for all that God does for us. <em>1 Thessalonians 5:16, Psalms 126:3</em></p>
						<p><strong>Peace</strong> - Allowing Christ to guide our hearts and minds will bring peace beyond our understanding. We will guide children in God's truths and help them to see how His ways offer a peaceful spirit. <em>Philippians 4:6-7</em></p>
						<p><strong>Patience</strong> - We are called to be patient and respond in love. In a world of so much instant gratification and constant entertainment, we will guide children in practicing patience. <em>Colossians 3:12-13</em></p>
						<p><strong>Kindness</strong> - Setting aside our desires and striving to put others before ourselves is a challenge at any age. We will guide children to be respectful of others and help them to see beyond themselves. <em>Ephesians 4:32</em></p>
						<p><strong>Goodness/Generosity</strong> - God provides in many ways and we all have something to give and share with others. We will guide children in understanding that God created us all uniquely and wonderfully and with different ideas. We can share our various gifts to help each other. <em>Romans 12:6-8</em></p>
						<p><strong>Gentleness</strong> - We must follow the example of Jesus and we are to stand out as Christians as different. God's ways do not always make sense, but they work for our own good. <em>Matthew 11:28-29</em></p>
						<p><strong>Faithfulness</strong> - In every situation, acknowledge that God is in control and working for our good. In all decisions seek God and trust His will be done. Be willing to take risks. <em>Romans 8:28, Hebrews 11:1,6</em></p>
						<p><strong>Self-Control</strong> - God has given us a spirit to guide us. <em>2 Timothy 1:7</em></p>

						<h1>Staff Core Values</h1>
					  </div>
					  <div class="ms-container2">
						<p><strong>Faith</strong> - Integrity - Honesty in all things without compromising the truth. Cultivate a sense of honesty and integrity in all that is said and done. Seek to do what is right before God. (<em>Proverbs 10:9, Proverbs 28:6, II Corinthians 8:21, Hebrews 13:18, Psalms 25:21</em>)</p>
						<p><strong>Intentional</strong> - We desire to be intentional in our ministry and mission focused. God came in human form with a mission. We want to be intentional with lessons, activities, interaction with children, parents, leaders, and our community as we follow Christ's example of His direct intent to love, teach and serve. (<em>John 3:16-17, I Corinthians 6:19-20</em>)</p>
						<p><strong>Environment</strong> - God is the founder of all things wonderful including imagination, curiosity, and creativity. To fan the flame, we will provide an ever-changing and stimulating environment where children can create life-long memories through creative play and interaction with God's creation. The children can expand their knowledge through hands-on activities that challenge the mind and promote the desire to learn. (<em>Genesis 1:1, Jeremiah 33:2-3</em>)</p>
						<p><strong>Individuality</strong> - Each child is a unique and special creation from God with different gifts, abilities, and strengths. Each child learns differently and at different rates. We cater to this premise in the environment and our curriculum adjusts to meet the needs of individual children in each classroom. (<em>Psalm 139:14, I Peter 4:10</em>)</p>
						<p><strong>Fun</strong> - Adopt a joyful spirit, celebrate life, and be adventurous. Embrace the wonder of being a child. (<em>I Thessalonians 5:16, Psalms 16:11, Proverbs 17:22, Jeremiah 29:11, John 15:11, Ephesians 5:19, Philippians 4:4</em>)</p>
						<p><strong>Positive</strong> - We are all created in the image of God. We recognize positive patterns are developed at a young age. We will be positive and encouraging in our interactions and environments. We will strive to uplift the children to see themselves through God's eyes and their value to Him and promote a good self-image. (<em>Psalm 139:13-16, I Corinthians 6:19-20</em>)</p>
						<p><strong>Passion</strong> - Love what you do and do what you love! We are passionate about making the learning process accessible, understandable, and exciting. This passion generates a whole-hearted devotion to making a difference in the lives of children and families. In this way, we honor the Lord Jesus and demonstrate His love to all who walk through our doors. (<em>Colossians 3:23, I Corinthians 10:31, Colossians 3:17</em>)</p>
						<p><strong>Love</strong> - God showed His unconditional love for us, and through our actions, we can demonstrate God's love to the children, families, co-workers, and everyone we meet. We know that while there are many aspects of our program that will support the growth of children, it is God's love that will last through their entire lifetime and into eternity. (<em>John 13:34-35, Mark 12:30-31, Colossians 3:14, I John 4:7-8, I Corinthians 13:13</em>)</p>
